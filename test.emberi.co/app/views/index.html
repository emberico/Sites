					<h1>We develop interactions</h1>
					<p>
						Every product is a conversation. Each interaction is an exchange. Emberi Co. makes every single interaction between you and your user worthwhile through formal design and inventive development. We're interaction developers, <a href="people/">a team</a> of one designer and one developer, who work closely with each other and your team not simply to solve problems, but to accomplish the goals that drive you. We are driven by what drives you: your users.
					</p>
					<p>
						We do this through our robust skillset that includes graphic design, web design, front-end and back-end web development, Android and iOS development, and more. We recognize trends, we identify needs, then we create and position products that make people happy.

					<h5>WEB</h5>
					<p>
						It's difficult to tell your story over the web.
						Our websites and web apps forego distracting aesthetics and confusing functionality. Instead, we focus on simplicity. Your users can focus on your product and you can focus on your business.

					<h5>MOBILE</h5>
					<p>
						The connectivity that defines the present world was achieved through relentless engineering. The <span class="italics">connectedness</span> that will define the future will be achieved through thoughtful design. These interfaces are effortless, natural, invisible.

						<h5>INTERACTION DEVELOPMENT</h5>
						<p>
							We like making web applications, we like making mobile applications. We also like making desktop apps, email campaigns, branding/identity, and lots of other stuff. But more than anything, we like crafting meaningful interactions. Creating a strong user experience across, between, and outside of your applications is key to <a href="philosophy/">our mission</a>, and it's key to your success.
						</p>
						<p>
							The true Emberi Co. experience spans your project from branding to marketing, from user research to product design, from development to management. We're not designers. We're not developers. Our skillset and our passion extends into, and far beyond, both of those. We're interaction developers.
